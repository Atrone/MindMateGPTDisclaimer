### Not a Replacement for Professional Help
Please note that this AI Therapist application is not a substitute for professional mental health services. The advice and insights offered by the AI are generated through machine learning algorithms and don't account for the full complexities of human emotions and circumstances. If you're struggling with serious mental health issues, please reach out to a licensed professional or a trusted person in your life.

### Accuracy of Advice
While every effort has been made to ensure the AI provides beneficial and accurate advice, there's always the chance that it may provide inappropriate or incorrect guidance. Always use your best judgement when considering the AI's advice and never rely on it for critical decisions.

### Liability
The creators of this AI Therapist application take no responsibility for any actions taken as a result of the advice provided by the AI. By using this tool, you understand and accept that any decisions you make based on the AI's advice are entirely your own responsibility.

### Emergency Situations
This AI is not capable of handling crisis situations. If you are in immediate danger or feeling suicidal, please reach out to a local emergency service immediately.
