      <h2>Interesting research results</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10254409/">Base GPT3 scores near perfect on EQ test (better than 99.9% of humans), while MindMateGPT scores perfect.</a></p>
      <p>MindMateGPT has much better insight the more you vent in the form and gives much better advice, usually the advice is more actionable and specific the more context you give in the form.</p>
      <p>MindMateGPT performs equal or better than Youper (another AI therapy tool) on a wide variety of tasks, and MindMateGPT almost invariably performs much better than Youper if you mindfully answer all the form questions.</p>
      <p>MindMateGPT has been tested to be ~25% more emotionally intelligent than ChatGPT. MindMateGPT has been tested to be ~25% more emotionally intelligent than Pi AI, exclusively on coping strategies, tactics, and actionable advice.

      <h2>Focus group results</h2>
      <p>After vetting the survey for duplicate entries, we were left with 10 users that participated in the focus group.</p>
      <p>The average user had used the app for 3 weeks, and the average frequency was daily.</p>
      <p>100% of the users felt the app helped them improve their mental health, and 90% of them felt the app gave them a better ability to handle emotional distress.</p>
      <p>The average perceived mental health score went from a 3.8 to a 8.4 on a 1-10 scale.</p>
